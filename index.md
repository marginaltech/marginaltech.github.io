### Software is a means to an end.

You might have been led to believe that your industry is being disrupted
by digital innovation and transformation.

Don't worry. It probably isn't. 

That's not to say companies that think like a technology company aren't an 
existential threat in your industry. Only that their methods are 
less bombastic than advertised.

*Systematically integrating software into bespoke business processes 
compounds modest, but substantive, benefits. In time, step-changes in how to do 
business become apparent and hard for competitors' to reproduce.*

It's not easy to do well. But it is more acheivable, and affordable, 
than what most of the technology industry will try and sell you.

### I help organisations elicit ends and execute means.

My experience is [broad and deep](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-mcewan-850a0a62). 
If you truly need the cutting-edge then I can 
provide that. Honestly, what most organisations need is someone who can understand them 
and deliver technical solutions that are effective, proportionate and sustainable.

Slick consultancies and big tech firms can't justify modesty or pragmatism in their 
business models. But I can.  

I became an independent consultant to do work that was more meaningful than the 
technology sector offers. I am a doer. I am thrifty. I embrace unfamilar domains 
and calculated risk.

You should consider me if you need more from consultancy than technology evangelism from an MBA.
