### Software is a means to an end.

You might have been led to believe that your industry is being disrupted
by digital innovation and transformations.

It isn't.  

The existential threat in most industries is genuine digital competence.
That threat is simple to understand and counter:

1. Methodically integrate automation and analytics into your business processes.
2. Compound modest, but substantive, capabilities that mutually reinforce insight and efficiency. 
3. In time, step-changes in how you could do business will be apparent and difficult for competitors to reproduce.

It's simple, but not easy. 

### I help organisations elicit ends and execute means.

Meaningful changes are effective, proportionate and sustainable. 

Let your competitors waste time and money indulging the grandiose 
fever dreams of speculating technologists.

I started a consultancy to do work that was meaningful, 
to both me and my clients. I called it Marginal Technologies 
to remind myself where value really lies.

My experience is [broad and deep](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-mcewan-850a0a62). 
I have a history of innovating in unfamiliar domains. I am a doer. Thrifty. Impact driven.
 
You should consider me if you need more from consultancy than technology evangelism from an MBA.
