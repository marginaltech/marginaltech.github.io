### Software is a means to an end.

You might have been led to believe that your industry is being disrupted
by digital innovation and transformations.

It isn't.  

Genuine technological competence is the existential threat in your industry.
But that threat is much simpler to understand and counter:

1. *Methodically integrate software automation and analytics into bespoke business processes.* 
2. *Compound modest, but substantive, benefits in terms of efficiency and insights.* 
3. *In time, step-changes in how to do business will become apparent and will be difficult for competitors' to reproduce.*

It's simple, but it's not easy. 

### I help organisations elicit ends and execute means.

After more than a decade in the technology industry, I became an independent consultant to do 
work that was more meaningful, for my clients and myself, than the grandiose fever dreams peddled 
by the big consultancies and firms. 

My experience is [broad and deep](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-mcewan-850a0a62). 
If you truly need the cutting-edge then I offer that. Honestly, what most organisations 
need is someone who can design and deliver technical solutions that are effective, 
proportionate and sustainable.

I am a doer. I am thrifty. I am impact driven. I embrace unfamilar domains.

You should consider me if you need more from consultancy than technology evangelism from an MBA.
