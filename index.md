### Software is a means to an end.

You might have been led to believe that your industry is being disrupted
by digital innovation and transformation.

Don't worry. It isn't. 

Which isn't to say that companies that can think like a technology company 
aren't an existential threat in your industry. Only that the path to competency 
is less bombastic than advertised.


1. *Systematically integrate software into bespoke business processes and
compound modest, but substantive, benefits.* 
2. *In time, step-changes in how to do business will become apparent and 
will be difficult for competitors' to reproduce.*

It's not easy to do well. But it is more achievable, and affordable, 
than what most of the technology industry will try and sell you.

### I help organisations elicit ends and execute means.

My experience is [broad and deep](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-mcewan-850a0a62). 
If you truly need the cutting-edge then I can offer that. Honestly, what most organisations 
need is someone who can deliver technical solutions that are effective, proportionate and sustainable.

Sadly, the business models of big consultancies and tech firms can't tolerate modesty 
or pragmatism. I became an independent consultant to do work that was more meaningful, 
for both myself and my clients, than the fever dreams of the technology sector. 

I am a doer. I am thrifty. I am impact driven. 
I embrace unfamilar domains, calculated risks and commercial collaboration.

You should consider me if you need more from consultancy than technology evangelism from an MBA.
