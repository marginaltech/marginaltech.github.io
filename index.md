### Software is a means to an end.

You might have been led to believe that your industry is being disrupted
by digital innovations and transformations.

For most industries, the threat and promise of "digitalisation" is real,
albeit overstated in order to upsell technology and support contracts to bamboozled 
incumbents. 

Innovation is not a product or service that can be bought in. The good news is that it is more 
broadly accessible, and affordable, than typically advertised. The bad news 
is that it requires nerve and a leap of faith that can be uncomfortable. 

It goes something like this:

1. Integrate automation and analytics into your processes.
2. Develop modest, but substantive, bespoke capabilities. 
3. Repeat, always reinforcing insight and efficiency. 
4. Step-changes in how you do business will become apparent and be difficult for competitors to reproduce.

This is technology as it is played, rather than as it is marketed.

It's simple, but not easy. 

### I help organisations elicit ends and execute means.

Let your competitors waste time and money indulging grandiose 
visions of a digital transformation.

I started my own consultancy to do work that was more 
meaningful, to both me and my clients. I called it Marginal Technologies 
to remind myself where value really lies: effective, proportionate and 
sustainable changes.

My experience is [broad and deep](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-mcewan-850a0a62). 
I have a history of innovating in unfamiliar domains. I am a doer. Thrifty. Impact driven.
 
You should consider me if you need more from consultancy than technology evangelism from an MBA. 

#### Thanks for reading. Talking is more fun.
