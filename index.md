### Software is a means to an end.

You might have been led to believe that your industry is being disrupted
by digital innovation and transformations.

The existential threat posed by technology in most industries is much 
simpler to understand and counter:

1. Methodically integrate automation and analytics into your business processes.
2. Compound modest bespoke capabilities that mutually reinforce insight and efficiency. 
3. Step-changes in how you do business will become apparent and be difficult for competitors to reproduce.

That's how technology companies do it. Simple, but not easy. 

### I help organisations elicit ends and execute means.

Meaningful change is effective, proportionate and sustainable. 

Let your competitors waste time and money indulging 
the grandiose speculation of the technology press.

I started a consultancy to do work that was more meaningful, 
to both me and my clients. I called it Marginal Technologies 
to remind myself where value really lies.

My experience is [broad and deep](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-mcewan-850a0a62). 
I have a history of innovating in unfamiliar domains. I am a doer. Thrifty. Impact driven.
 
You should consider me if you need more from consultancy than technology evangelism from an MBA.
