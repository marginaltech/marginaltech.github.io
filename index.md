### Software is a means to an end.

You might have been led to believe that your industry is being disrupted
by digital innovation and transformation.

Don't worry. It probably isn't. 

The existential threat in your industry are incumbents that really 
learn to execute like a technology company. But that threat is simple 
to understand and counter.

1. *Systematically integrate software automation into bespoke processes 
and compound modest, but substantive, benefits.* 
2. *In time, step-changes in how to do business will become apparent and 
be difficult for competitors' to reproduce.*

That's easier said than done. But its more achievable, and affordable, 
than what the technology sector will try to sell you.

### I help organisations elicit ends and execute means.

My experience is [broad and deep](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-mcewan-850a0a62). 
If you truly need the cutting-edge then I offer that. Honestly, what most organisations 
need is someone who can design and deliver technical solutions that are effective, 
proportionate and sustainable.

The business models of big consultancies and tech firms won't tolerate simply meeting 
clients' needs. They need to upsell grand visions and fever dreams. I became an independent 
consultant to do work that was more meaningful, to both me and my clients. 

I am a doer. I am thrifty. I am impact driven. I embrace unfamilar domains, calculated 
risks and commercial collaboration.

You should consider me if you need more from consultancy than technology evangelism from an MBA.
