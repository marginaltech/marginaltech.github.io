### Software is a means to an end.

You might have been led to believe that your industry is being disrupted
by digital innovation and transformations.

Certainly, a lot of people have a financial incentive 
in making "digitalisation" appear impressive, confusing and expensive.

I believe the threat and promise of technology in most industries is 
more broadly accessible than advertised. It goes like this:

1. Integrate automation and analytics into your processes.
2. Develop modest, but substantive, bespoke capabilities. 
3. Repeat, reinforcing insight and efficiency. 
4. Step-changes in how you do business will become apparent and be difficult for competitors to reproduce.

Innovation isn't speculation. Disciplined reinvestment 
of marginal gains in private is what drives the unexpected 
leaps in capability deemed innovative in public.

This is technology as it is played, rather than as it is sold.

It's simple, but not easy. 

### I help organisations elicit ends and execute means.

Let your competitors waste time and money indulging grandiose 
visions of a digital transformation.

I started my own consultancy to do work that was more 
meaningful, to both me and my clients. I called it Marginal Technologies 
to remind myself where value really lies: in complementary changes 
that are effective, proportionate and sustainable.

My experience is [broad and deep](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-mcewan-850a0a62). 
I have a history of innovating in unfamiliar domains. I am a doer. Thrifty. Impact driven.
 
You should consider me if you need more from consultancy than technology evangelism from an MBA. 

#### Thanks for reading. Talking is more fun.
