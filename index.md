### Software is a means to an end.

You might have been led to believe that your industry is being disrupted
by digital innovation and transformations.

The existential threat posed by technology in most industries is much 
simpler to understand and counter:

1. Methodically integrate automation and analytics into your business processes.
2. Compound modest bespoke capabilities that mutually reinforce insight and efficiency. 
3. Step-changes in how you do business will become apparent and be difficult for competitors to reproduce.

Simple, but not easy. 

Like many things in life, the passage of time between (2) and (3) is crucial and 
under-appreciated. Innovation appears sudden from the outside, but is a compounding 
process on the inside. You can't buy your way straight to (3), although plenty of people will 
sell you that if you are buying.

### I help organisations elicit ends and execute means.

Meaningful changes are effective, proportionate and sustainable. 

I started a consultancy to do hands-on work that was more meaningful, 
to both me and my clients. I called it Marginal Technologies to remind 
myself where value really lies.

My experience is [broad and deep](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-mcewan-850a0a62). 
I have a history of innovating in unfamiliar domains. I am a doer. Thrifty. Impact driven.
 
You should consider me if you need more from consultancy than technology evangelism from an MBA.
