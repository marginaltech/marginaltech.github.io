### Software is a means to an end.

You might have been led to believe that your industry is being disrupted
by digital innovation and transformations.

It isn't.  

The existential threat in most industries is genuine digital competence.
That is much simpler to understand:


1. Methodically integrate automation and analytics into your business processes.
2. Compound modest, but substantive, benefits in terms of efficiency and insight. 
3. In time, this compounding will make step-changes in your business 
    apparent and difficult for competitors to reproduce.

It's simple, but not easy. 

### I help organisations elicit ends and execute means.

My experience is [broad and deep](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-mcewan-850a0a62).
I have a history of innovating in unfamiliar domains. If you truly need the cutting-edge 
that's fine. More likely, you need capabilities that are effective, proportionate and sustainable. 

Let your competitors waste time and money indulging the grandiose 
fever dreams of big tech firms and consultancies.

I became an independent consultant to do work that was more meaningful, 
to both me and my clients. I called the company Marginal Technologies 
to remind myself where value really lies.

You should consider me if you need more from consultancy than technology evangelism from an MBA. 

#### It's more fun when you talk too
